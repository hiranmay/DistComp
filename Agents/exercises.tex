\section*{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Would you call a room air-conditioner an agent? Provide arguments for and against.
	\item Characterize the environment of an autonomous passenger car in terms of the properties described in 
		section~\ref{sec:agents:environment}.
	\item Review any one of the multi-agent systems cited in section~\ref{sec:agents:mas}. Identify the main
		contributions with reference to communication and coordination of agents.
	\item Implement contract net interaction protocol for task allocation, following FIPA standards. The complete
		set of standards are available at \url{http://fipa.org/}. 
	\item Implement task allocation process as described in section~\ref{sec:agents:tasks} on JADE platform, using
		contract-net protocol.

	\item Implement ant colony optimization algorithm discussed in section~\ref{sec:agents:aco} with a few connected
		cities as shown in figure~\ref{fig:agents:ant-exercise}, where $I$ denotes the initial (start) node, and
		$G$ denotes the goal (destination) node. Assume that the distance estimate between any 
		pair of connected nodes is 1. Verify that all agents converge to a shortest path after a few iterations.
