\section{Conclusion}

Agent based architecture is an attractive modeling tool in the world populated with many autonomous intelligent agent.
Though we use the word ``intelligent agent'', the level of intelligence in the individual agents may vary depending
on application needs. In particular, the individual agents, when embodied on low cost hardware, may have very simple 
logic built into them. System level intelligence emerges as a result of interaction between these agents. Therefore,
communication and coordination of the distributed agents assume great significance in realizing agent-based systems.

We have primarily discussed the mechanism of communication and coordination of agents in a cooperative setup, where
all the agents share a common system goal. Coordination of agents in an adversarial or competitive setup involves
game-theoretic approaches and strategic planning, which is beyond the scope of discussion in this book. Large
distributed systems, participated by agents from unknown origin, brings in many issues of security and trust. We
shall see some methods for addressing such issues in distributed setup in the next chapter.
